# Sentiment Analysis of Data Science Job Reviews on Glassdoor

## Project Overview
This project involves **web scraping** Glassdoor reviews for data science job postings to **analyze sentiment** and explore how review ratings correlate with textual sentiment. The goal is to understand how employees describe their experiences and whether sentiment aligns with the number of stars given.

### Web Scrapping Glassdoor Data 
Since Glassdoor lacks a public API, I used `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract job listings and reviews. However, scraping was limited due to a `403 Forbidden` error after a small number of requests.

Example Scraping Function:


```python
def get_page(url, headers):
    """Fetch webpage content using BeautifulSoup."""
    try:
        req = Request(url, headers=headers)
        page = urlopen(req)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(page, "html.parser")
        return soup
    except HTTPError as e:
        print(f"Error opening page {e}")
```

### Text Preprocessing
In order to proceed with sentiment analysis, I had to perform text preprocessing which involved the below. When working on NLP projects, I am usually a big fan of the NLTK library, but this time I wanted to try out TextBlob. 

* Removed punctuation, numbers, and stopwords
* Tokenized text using **TextBlob** instead of **NLTK**


Example of cleaning reviews:
```python
# assign new clean review column
df = df.assign(clean_review = df.reviews.map(lambda x: ' '.join(TextBlob(str(x)).words)))
```

### Data Exploration & Visualization
Once the data is cleaned I can finally move on to the fun part, visualizations! I created a **word cloud** from the most frequent words in the reviews:

Top words included *good, work, people, great, benefits, culture, balance, pay, management, life*, reflecting common themes in workplace discussions.

## Sentiment Analysis
### TextBlob Sentiment Analysis
TextBlob measures:

* **Polarity** (-1 to 1): Negative to positive sentiment
* **Subjectivity** (0 to 1): Objective to subjective content

Here is an example:

```python 
sample_review = df['clean_review'].iloc[0]
TextBlob(sample_review).sentiment  
```

*Observations:*

* Higher-rated companies didnâ€™t always have higher polarity scores.
* Some lower-rated reviews had neutral or even positive sentiment.


### VADER Sentiment Analysis
VADER provides:

* **Positive, Neutral, Negative scores**
* **Compound score** (-1 to 1), summarizing overall sentiment

Here is an example:

```python 
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
sid.polarity_scores(sample_review)
```


### Sentiment vs. Star Ratings
While VADER's compound scores showed a clearer relationship with ratings, inconsistencies still emerged.

## Conclusion
While sentiment analysis provides valuable insights, review ratings donâ€™t always align with textual sentiment. This raises questions about how employees rate companies and whether numerical ratings alone reflect job satisfaction.
